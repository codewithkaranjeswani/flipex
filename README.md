# Flipkart Attribute Prediction on Fashion dataset
Using a 26-class Resnext classifier initialized with pretrained model (which is trained on ILSVRC dataset - 1.2M natural images with 1000 classes) for classifying categories (26 categories available).

# Todo
1. Better methodology for attribute prediction.
2. Split train/val with same class distribution as in total data
3. Log Loss and Accuracy in train.py and test.py
4. Log all test predictions in test.py
